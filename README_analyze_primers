This is a file provided to me by Tony Walters to fix incompatibility issues with Primer Prospector.

If you have QIIME <=1.8.0 installed, you should be OK.  If you have >=1.9.0, you will need to
replace the existing file in your installed pprospector lib directory with the version
included in the akutils/akutils_resources directory.  You may need administrator access to do this.

On my system, I had to replace the following file:
/home/enggen/qiime_software/pprospector-1.0.1-release/lib/python2.7/site-packages/primerprospector/analyze_primers.py
