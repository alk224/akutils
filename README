# This is a collection of scripts I wrote to make myself more productive
# while doing microbial ecology work with QIIME. I was having difficulty
# knowing that I was making the best decisions in my analyses, so I
# started writing this as an exercise in getting to know the QIIME
# commands that I was using better.  I can now use it to run many OTU
# picking workflows in a row and it generates many of the plots and
# stats that I like to have access to right away.  For more information
# on the functionality of akutils, check out the wiki pages:
#
# https://github.com/alk224/akutils/wiki
# 
# I do everything on a Linux system (Ubuntu 14.04).  I have also tested
# most of them on CentOS 6.6 (monsoon at NAU). You should be comfortable
# installing packages and such that these scripts might require.  I will
# try to include in help functions what dependencies are required, but
# here is a short list which should cover most of these tools:
#
# 1) QIIME 1.9.0 (https://qiime.org)
# 2) ea-utils (https://code.google.com/p/ea-utils/)
# 3) Fastx toolkit (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/)
# 4) vsearch (https://github.com/torognes/vsearch)
# 5) ITSx (http://microbiology.se/software/itsx/)
# 6) Smalt (https://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/smalt/)
# 7) HMMer v3+ (http://hmmer.janelia.org/)
#
# Install these and then you can use my scripts.  If they break for you,
# I probably can't help.  Mostly because I don't really have any
# computer science background and moreso because I am a graduate student
# with not a whole lot of time.  Still if you find any problems or have
# ideas for useful functionality, you can submit an issue via github:
#
# https://github.com/alk224/akutils/issues
#
# **********************************************************************
#
# Installing:
#
# The easiest way to install akutils is to clone the repo.  You need git
# installed (default on many systems).
#
# git clone https://github.com/alk224/akutils.git
#
# Then add the repo directory to your path.  That's it!
#
# **********************************************************************
#
# Updating:
#
# If (when) I make useful changes, I will push them to the repo. To 
# benefit from these changes, navigate to your akutils directory and
# type:
#
# git pull
#
# After this, you want to rerun the config utility:
#
# akutils_config_utility.sh
#
# and choose "rebuild" to make a fresh global config file.  Older local
# config files may not function correctly after an update.  Some scripts
# may miss a variable import without a config file to match the version
# of that script.
