# This is a collection of scripts I wrote to make myself more
# productive while doing microbial ecology work with QIIME
# on a Linux system (Ubuntu 14.04).  I have also tested most of 
# them on CentOS 6 (monsoon at NAU). You should be comfortable
# installing packages and such that these scripts might require.
# I will try to include in help functions what dependencies are 
# required, but here is a short list which should cover most of
# these tools:
#
# 1) QIIME 1.9.0 (https://qiime.org)
# 2) ea-utils (https://code.google.com/p/ea-utils/)
# 3) Fastx toolkit (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/)
# 4) ITSx (http://microbiology.se/software/itsx/)
# 5) Smalt (https://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/smalt/)
# 6) HMMer v3+ (http://hmmer.janelia.org/)
#
# Install these and then you can use my scripts.  Still, if
# they break for you, I probably can't help.  
#
# *************************************************************
#
# The easiest way to get these tools is to first clone the repo
#
# git clone https://github.com/alk224/akutils.git
#
# Then add the repo directory to your path.  That's it!
