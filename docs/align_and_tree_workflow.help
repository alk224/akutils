Usage:
align_and_tree_workflow.sh <target directory> <mode>

	Valid modes are 16S or other (cap sensitive).
	-- 16S will do PyNAST alignment using # threads in config file.
	-- other will do Mafft alignment and filter the top 10% entropic
	sites.
	-- Target directory must contain file(s) titled (*_rep_set.fna)
	-- If ALL (caps sensitive) is supplied for target directory,
	script will operate on all OTU subdirectories (*_otus_*).

This script takes an input directory and aligns a representative
sequence set (*_rep_set.fna), filters the alignment, and produces a
phylogenetic tree.  This is done according to mode.  16S mode does a
PyNAST alignment using the specified number of threads and against the 
alignment template and referenced in your akutils config file, filters
against the lanemask referenced in the config file, and builds a
phylogeny using default fasttree parameters in QIIME.  Other mode does a
Mafft alignment (single core only, no template used) and filters the top
10% most entropic sites prior to making a phylogeny (fasttree default).

The workflow references a config file.  You can reference a global
config file (default), or a local one, if present in the directory this
script is executed on, will be referenced instead.  Config files can be
defined with the config utility by issuing:

akutils_config_utility.sh

Example:
align_and_tree_workflow.sh swarm_otus_d1/ 16S

This example will look for a fasta file called "*_rep_set.fna" residing
in the target directory (swarm_otus_d1/) align the sequences using
PyNAST, filter against the lanemask in your config file, and make a tree
with fasttree.

Example:
align_and_tree_workflow.sh ALL other

This example will look for a fasta file called "*_rep_set.fna" residing
in any subdirectory that has "*_otus_*" in the directory name, align the
sequences using Mafft, filter the top 10% entropic sites, and make a
tree with fasttree.  It will do this for every otu subdirectory within
the execution directory.

Workflow details:
	1) Alignment (PyNAST or Mafft)
	2) Filter alignment
	3) Make phylogeny

Output:
Alignments and phylogenies will be found within the target OTU picking
directory and will be named according to method used.  For example:

swarm_otus_d1/pynast_alignment/fasttree_phylogeny.tre
